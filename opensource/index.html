<p>IBM Streams allows customers to write their own Streams apps to analyze data in transit. To do this, Streams provides a set of open source "toolkits" which provide the backend logic necssary for the data input/output and analysis. While writing a tutorial article for IBM Streams to connect to REST APIs, I encountered issues with the inet toolkit's web request functionality, so I dug into the code and submitted some bugfixes. Here are the issues I resolved:

<ul>
    <li>Long password handling - existing toolkit would choke on long passwords due to the base64 encoding library used. It was truncating encoded strings.</li>
    <li>Encode HTTP headers as ASCII to better conform to the HTTP spec.</li>
    <li>Allow users to add arbitrary header fields.</li>
    <li>Add a setting to disable SSL verification - similar to cURL's `-k` field.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Another article, another toolkit fix. This time it was an article about connecting Streams to Hadoop via HDFS. To connect to BigInsights, IBM's cloud-hosted Hadoop offering, the toolkit needed an enhancement to allow unlimited encryption key length.</p>

</h3>
<p>While writing an alert syncing tool for IBM Streams cloud service's transition to New Relic, I had to fix the Alert Conditions API which was out of date with the New Relic REST API. Fortunately, I just had to rename a JSON parameter. This alert syncing tool allowed us to store our alerting thresholds in a yaml file in version control and sync them with a simple command.</p>

</h3>
<p>I decided to contribute to a game I enjoyed called Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. I dug up this issue and spun up a development environment on a Linux VM. Previously players were allowed to install multiple guns on a single vehicle turret. This was unintended behavior, so I made the change to only allow a single turret. Fun little contribution!</p>
