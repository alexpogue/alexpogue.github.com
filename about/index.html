<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
Hey there, I'm Alex. I am a software engineer new hire at IBM. After just three years of college, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science from Iowa State University. I like long walks on the beach and playing in ball pits when I get the chance. I created this blog to follow my thoughts through my adventure into the corporate world. I write about anything that is on my mind at the time, however incoherent it may be. Enjoy!
