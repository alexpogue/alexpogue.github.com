<a href="newrelic/">IBM Streams Cloud service monitoring system</a>
</h3>
<p>I renovated the old monitoring system for Streaming Analytics - the IBM Streams cloud service from collectd/Graphite/Seyren/PagerDuty to New Relic/ServiceNow/PagerDuty. In the process I developed an intimate understanding of each part of a monitoring system from data collection, storage, metrics databases, alerting thresholds, Jenkins integration, and integration / alert forwarding to other services.</p>

<a href="rockypoint/">Gameboy Advance zombie shooter</a>
</h3>
<p>Rocky Point is a zombie shooter Gameboy Advance game. Built as a team of three at HackISU. This was my first real dive into low level programming, and it turned out pretty well. I worked on backend game logic. I also made the textures and that wicked cool font.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the gba.js player is a GBA emulator in JavaScript. I take no credit for it</p>
